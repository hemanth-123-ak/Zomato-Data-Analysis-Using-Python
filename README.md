# Zomato-Data-Analysis-Using-Python
This project focuses on analyzing Zomato’s restaurant dataset to gain insights into the food industry trends, customer preferences, and restaurant performance. The analysis was performed using Python, leveraging libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

Numpy–      With Numpy arrays, complex computations are executed quickly, and large calculations are handled efficiently.

Matplotlib– It has a wide range of features for creating high-quality plots, charts, histograms, scatter plots, and more.

Pandas–     The library simplifies the loading of data frames into 2D arrays and provides functions for performing multiple analysis tasks in a single operation.

Seaborn–    It offers a high-level interface for creating visually appealing and informative statistical graphics.
